nbtool: a golang tool to operate on netbrane common format files
nbtool can :
	unzip netbrane files (.nb) , 
	extract ranges or all the entries from unzipped netbrane files (.unb) in binary (len+pb) or json
	count the number of entries in a .unb file

it handles both netbrane v1 and v2 common format files.

usage:

unzip a compressed nb file
	./nbtool unzip foo.nb

count the number of entries in a file
	./nbtool count foo.unb

extract the first entry in a file as protobuf
	./nbtool -outformat pb -ranges 1 extract foo.unb

extract the first entry as protobuf from every file in the list of arguments (works in parallel)
	./nbtool -outformat pb -ranges 1:1:1 extract foo1.unb foo2.unb foo3.unb

extract ranges of entries as json from a file
	./nbtool -outformat json -ranges 1-10,20-30,40-45 extract foo.unb

extract different ranges as json on multiple files (works in parallel)
	./nbtool -outformat json -ranges 1-10,20-30:2-3,40-55 extract foo1.unb foo2.unb
